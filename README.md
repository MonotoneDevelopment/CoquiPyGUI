# CoquiPyGUI
Tkinter/Python GUI for the CoquiTTS tool.

A graphical frontend for the Coqui Text to Speech synthesizer, which is usually accessed on the command line.

This depends on TTS, which can be installed using this command:

```
pip3 install TTS
```

Note: You may need to run the program via the command line, using ```python3 /location/of/program.py```, or else it won't synthesize.
